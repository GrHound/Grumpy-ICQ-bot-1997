# Grumpy-ICQ-bot-1997
This is a repository of C code implementing an ICQ chat bot or, alternatively, a Linux command-line based tool).  ICQ was a chat service in the late 1990s. Grumpy was implemented in 1997 on the basis of the plain bot 'splotch.c' by Duane Fields, but with several modifications such as maintaining topicality per ICQ user.
