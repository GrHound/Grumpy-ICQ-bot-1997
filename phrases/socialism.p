Attempts to solve the problem of unemployment by tinkering with the present
system are futile. The cycle of booms and recessions is an unavoidable part
of capitalism.

Having channel vision again? You are good in fabricating stories? No wonder
guy's like you praise the lord and screw the working man in the same time.
.phrase
I am almost retired, but I wish there would be another revolution so somebody
could rattle you chains.
.phrase
Union advocate:  someone who has confidence in themselves 
and their social relations, willing to work with colleagues
(and financially support) to elect some leaders 
(or employees hired by the elected leaders)
in order to benefit the many rather than succumb to 
the top dog in the hierarchy.
.phrase
But does reality necessitate a tiny minority of people
owning the means of production and so controlling the
livelihoods of millions of others ?
.phrase
If Fidel Castro booked a stay in a privately-owned hotel while in the
U.S., are you going to use this as evidence that he is a raving
capitalist?
.phrase
 "It was not by gold or by silver, but by labor, that all the
 wealth of the world was originally purchased."  
 (Adam Smith, "The Wealth of Nations")
.phrase
In The Wealth of Nations, even Adam Smith himself wrote with realism 
about manufacturers and merchants. He described them as 

"men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the 
 public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to 
 oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions,
 both deceived and oppressed it." 

Know your literature, man!

What really interests me is that you ignored the crux of the argument and that 
was that public education in the US suffered because the Raygunite/Bush 
administration sacked the education budget in order to pay for the military. 
.phrase
While we're on the subject, you do realise that private school education 
actually costs the American taxpayer more per student than public education 
does don't you? No? Well check it up and get back to be when you actually have 
an argument rather than a series of rantings.

Prosperous Irish farmers sold corn in England because the
English could pay more for it. Starving Irish peasants
didn't have money, so the laissez-faire capitalist UK
government let them starve.
.phrase
The Israel kibbutzim are a perfect example that a small number
of people with similar goals and ideology can maintain a
small socialist community.  This is something that virtually
everyone would support, don't you think?
.phrase
Countries with high inequalities of wealth (e.g. the US
as compared to Norway), tend to have more poverty-related diseases
(TB etc) than the more egalitarian countries. Therefore, the
life expectancy figure is dragged down for the US by
the fact that the poor die fairly young.
In contrast, countries like Norway, due to their expensive and
generous welfare systems, ensure that inequalities of wealth
are reduced. Therefore, there are less poverty-related diseases
in Norway than in the US.
.phrase
We need a revolutionary government that takes over private industry and uses
control over its revenue to ensure sufficient spending to fully employ
economic resources. This takeover would begin with existing large scale
industry and eventually cover the entire economy.
.phrase
This past experience of recent years is not a reason to be pessimistic about 
the eventual victory of socialist revolution. There is nothing surprising about 
long-term historical processes meeting short term setbacks. Nothing in this world
develops smoothly. Take for instance, the long and arduous transition from
feudalism to modern capitalism. Feudal ideas and practices turned out to be
very resilient indeed.
