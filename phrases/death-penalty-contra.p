Do you also accept the moral responsibility for subsequent murders committed
by the actual perpetrator(s) of (other) murders for which someone else was
wrongfully convicted (and, maybe, put to death)?
.phrase
If a convicted person is dangerous enough, they can and should be kept in
jail, in solitary confinement if necessary. But capital punishment is just
giving the wrong examples to the people.
.phrase
Whatever judicial system is used, there is always the danger of a mistake
being made. There must therefore always be an avenue for the convicted to
appeal.
.phrase
Capital punishment works quite well, as long as you can guarantee that 
everyone who is convicted in a death-penalty case is, indeed, guilty.  If
you can't guarantee that, then you may - or more likely, will -
kill an innocent person sooner or later. 
.phrase
Until today, the elected governments in the US are only mildly blood thirsty.
In the days of McCarthy, this was already quite something different.
Imagine, for example what happens if an extremist is elected tomorrow, and 
the smoking of cigarettes or the possession of guns become a capital offense. 
I'm convinced this would change the opinions on capital punishment quite 
radically.
