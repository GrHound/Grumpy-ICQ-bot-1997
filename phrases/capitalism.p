There IS a revolution going on, but you Union types are too stupid to notice.
Companies are taking their work overseas because they are tired of dealing with
high taxes, stifling bureaucracy, and uneducated blue-collar types who think
that they are the most exploited people in the work force...
.phrase
If you think that management is ripping you off (and that you can do better),
then scrape together your OWN capital, start your OWN business, design your OWN
equipment, develop your OWN manufacturing process, write up your OWN marketing
plan, and put the rest of us out of business!!!

UNION MAN: A man who has so little confidence and sense of self-worth that he is
willing to give his individual negotiating power (and union dues) over to some
Mafia thug who spends his pension contribution on whores and liberal politicians
(same difference) in turn for his "representation"...
.phrase
Look at almost any union leader and you'll find a man whose lack of
work skills, unwillingness to work, and inability to change,  denied
him advancement. Those, plus a rabble-rousing talent and the gift of
the gab are the only qualifications for union leadership.
.phrase
Excuse me, I pay the government to listen to me.  I hardly call that
'unsolicited.'
.phrase
Let's not forget that left=(Lat.)sinister=evil,
while right=(Lat.)dexter=adroit.  This is actually biblical in origin -
on Gotterdamerung or Ragnarok or Judgement Day or whatever it's
currently called, the saved will pass on the right, while the sinful
will pass by the left.  Of course, it begs the question, is that's God's
left or mine??
.phrase
It is commonly accepted knowledge that Clinton the "Slickemeister" went to Russia
in 1969. He traveled extensively through the Soviet bloc and while
there stayed at the homes of prominent Communist leaders including Bedrich
Kopolds.  Clinton attended meetings of "Group 68" a pro-Soviet group and
actually booked his travel in and out of Russia through Intourist - the
"State" travel agency. This has ALL been reported by the London Sunday
Times in the past.
.phrase
As it currently stands, a fair percentage of the Western population
knows almost nothing of the human rights record of Communist regimes,
considering Communism a noble ideal that people weren't virtuous
enough to practice. 
.phrase
It may be unfashionable but I would like to make a stand for
capitalism/imperialism not  as an a priori system, but as the
best currently conceivable form of social structure.
.phrase
Adam Smith and J. S. Mill were well aware of the actual and
possible defects of capitalism. But neither one of them exhibited the 
quasi-religious nostalgic utopianism of contemporary libertarianism, 
nor did they attempt to conflate capitalism with anarchy.
.phrase
capitalism (noun),
  An economic system in which the means of production and distribution
  are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to
  the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market.

  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 1991 by
  Columbia University Press.
.phrase
A capitalist economic system, in order to function at its most efficient, 
requires the right to own private property, as well as freedom of expression 
and action (within ethical and legal limits). To the extent these rights are 
violated, capitalism becomes less efficient.  Unlike socialism, which requires 
restriction of freedom to function at al (did you realize that?).
.phrase
As someone pointed out, the stock exchange, while symbolic in the
public's mind of private ownership, has little to do with capitalism.
It simply establishes a secondary market to promote the liquidity of
the investment, raising the value of the equity.
.phrase
 No politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so
eloquently or has benefited mankind so greatly as capitalism--and none has
ever been attacked so savagely, viciously, and blindly. The flood of
misinformation, misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood
about capitalism is such that the young people of today have no idea
(and virtually no way of discovering any idea) of its actual nature.
