In the logs/ directory, there are folders of which the name is the integer UIN code for the ICQ user. The .zip file contains many dialogs from the era 1997-2000.
If Grumpy is reimplemented, the ./logs/ directory will get populated with user interactions. However, in standalone mode (command line) there is a fixed dummy UIN because there is evidently no embedding in ICQ.
