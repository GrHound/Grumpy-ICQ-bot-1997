Before the chatbot obtained the persona "Grumpy" it technically was a combination of a modified exiting chatbot Splotch by Duane Fields and an ICQ chat server interface tool by an anonymous user. ICQ was provided by the Israeli company Mirabilis since 1996. The combination of tools yielded the name SPLICQ for internal use. After experimentation it appeared that the bot came across as grumpy, hence the final public name "GRUMPY".
