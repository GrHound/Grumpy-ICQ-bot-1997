This is a list of planned improvements to Micq so you all know what I'm 
working on and so I don't forget anything. :)
The order is random I'll add things depending on how I feel at the moment. :)

TCP connections.
File transfer
chat
deamon mode.
support for scripts
turn it into a lib for GUI programmers.
Alter your personal info, partially done.
Automatically log back in.
Support for larger contact lists.
More countries identified.
ICQ status flags identified
automatically change to away mode.
80 column mode for dumb terminals.
multi-language

There's probably other stuff I forgot.  If you have any ideas let me know 
and I'll add them to the list.
